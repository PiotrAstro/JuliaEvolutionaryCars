# Notes and settings:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Julia version:
# Julia version should be the same on every machine
# I should have a separate channel and set my julia to it (not release, cause it will print strange statements to update)
# to do so:
# 1. install juliaup - msstore (preferable) or installer at https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup
# 2. "juliaup status" to see currently installed channels
# 3. "juliaup add 1.11.2" to add new channel if it doest exist, important! there should exist channel with this name, not only this version in release channel
# 4. "juliaup default 1.11.2" to set this channel as default
# 5. "juliaup status" to see if it is set correctly

# In the future, if I would like to specify which julia version to use for different runs, I could add exename entry and set it 
# to use some channel, e.g. "exename" => "julia +1.11.2"

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# General info:
# I have scripts that will copy all files tracked by git from main machine to all other machines
# So make sure that git is working correctly on main machine
# it runs:

# files = readlines(`git ls-files -c -m -o --exclude-standard`)
# unique!(files)
# existing_files = filter(file -> isfile(file) && file != project_archive, files)

# so it will list files:
# -c: shows cached/tracked files
# -m: shows modified tracked files
# -o: shows other (untracked) files
# --exclude-standard: only excludes files that are in .gitignore
# then remove duplicates
# and filter those that were recently deleted

# Project.toml shoud be in the main git folder
# So eventually if the current project has git, it will get all files in the current form (not one from git, but local one) and exclude those from gitignore

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# SSH keys:
# Generating keys for ssh, on client (your_file_name is private, your_file_name.pub is public):
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh\your_file_name

# Now on server I can use same key on all servers, I should do on each server:
# open or create file C:\Users\username\.ssh\authorized_keys  if username is not in administrator group
# open or create file C:\ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys if username is in administrator group (it doesnt have to be admin, but to have admin rights)
# paste to this file content of your_file_name.pub

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# SSH server
# I should check for ssh server in settings -> system -> additional functions and add ssh server
# Then go to "Us≈Çugi" and start ssh server

# then add these rules in admin powershell to let ssh through firewall:
# New-NetFirewallRule -Name "SSH" -DisplayName "SSH" -Description "Allow SSH" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 22 -Action Allow
# New-NetFirewallRule -Name "SSH-Out" -DisplayName "SSH" -Description "Allow SSH" -Direction Outbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 22 -Action Allow

# also I may have to add Julia to allowed apps through firewall (Julia establish its own connection separate from ssh)
# I should go to "Panel sterowania\System i zabezpieczenia\Zapora Windows Defender\Dozwolone aplikacje"
# then add real path to julia, e.g. C:\Users\admin\.julia\juliaup\julia-1.11.2+0.x64.w64.mingw32\bin\julia.exe

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# MKL
# for MKL on windows I should install smth like:
# https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
